[{"categories":null,"content":"Hello! I\u0026rsquo;m Sloth (he/him), a WNY-based chronic shitposter. I am not a Bills fan, as I value the structural integrity of my tables.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been around various parts of the internet in various capacities. I was an MMO livestreamer for a very long time, but have recently burned out of the genre. Nowadays, most of my gaming time is spent catching up on all of the long single-player RPGs I\u0026rsquo;ve been neglecting.\nIn real life, I\u0026rsquo;m a CNC machinist with a specialty in non-metal parts. I\u0026rsquo;ve even made a part that went to Mars!\nThis blog is mostly a braindump mechanism. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;ll find it interesting. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n(Let it be known that this was the moment in time I learned how to type the shrug kaomoji in markdown without it breaking.

Initially, I started out with an automatic brewing machine and a grinder, which is still extremely useful. If I wake up late and need coffee fast, it does the job!\nShould a miracle occur and I manage to wake up on time, I\u0026rsquo;ll make my morning coffee with my French press. I got inspired to learn how to make higher quality coffee after playing Persona 5 Royal and getting carried on SP sustain by Sojiro\u0026rsquo;s brewing lessons.\nmaybe someday I\u0026rsquo;ll have time to learn how to do a pourover\u0026hellip;\nI started off with a really tiny one I snagged for $10 on clearance at the grocery store and absolutely fell in love with the taste, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really satisfied with only making one half-cup of coffee at a time. After doing a bit of research and finding a good method, I committed to a larger press. Hoffmann\u0026rsquo;s method of taking it slow and lazy makes for a really bold cup of coffee, but it\u0026rsquo;s a bit too strong for me. I lowered the grouds from 60g to 45g and love the result.\nMy only regret in switching to higher quality coffee is not being able to stomach shitty coffee anymore. Tim Horton\u0026rsquo;s is barely drinkable. The coffee in my work\u0026rsquo;s breakroom is probably poisoned. I am in a delicious hell of my own making, and my only solace is local coffee beans. The local grocery store stocks Finger Lakes Coffee, which has a lot of different roasts. Everything I\u0026rsquo;ve tried so far is fantastic, but if I had to pick a favorite it\u0026rsquo;d be Blueberry Cobbler.\nIf any of this sounds appealing, you\u0026rsquo;re one of us. There\u0026rsquo;s no going back. Bask in your high-ish effort coffee as you pass the peasants stuck in the drive-thru line. You\u0026rsquo;re better than them, for you have achieved enlightenment.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/french-press/","tags":null,"title":"I Own a French Press Now"},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/manifest.json","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.de/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.es/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.fr/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.hi/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.jp/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.nl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.pl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.ru/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.zh-cn/","tags":null,"title":""}]
